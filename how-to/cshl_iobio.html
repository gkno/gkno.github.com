    The goal of this page is to highlight the iobio real-time analysis and visualization suite. We will discuss the philosophy of the project and showcase (interactively) the available iobio apps.

  <!-- What is iobio? -->
  <div class='section-subtitle'>What is iobio?</div>
  <div class='description'>
    iobio is a platform on which web-based genomic analysis apps can be built. Analysis is built on providing real-time visually driven analysis of data. This helps us promote an exploratory approach to data analysis.

  <!-- Data visualization -->
  <div class='section-subtitle'>Data visualization</div>
  <div class='description'>
    Humans are very visual animals. We are very good at spotting patterns in data, and quickly developing questions and theories about data, if we can only see the data presented in an intuitive manner. With iobio, we are trying to provide such visualizations for a broad set of genomic analysis problems. As we proceed through this tutorial, we will see the different iobio apps and how we present and interact with our data.

    To truly explore our data, we need to be able to visualize our data very quickly. In fact, our goal is to visualize data immediately after data selection. We then want to have an analysis loop where we can form questions about the data, then ask questions, change analysis parameters etc. and immediately see the results of these changes. With such quick turnaround of analyses, we can really dig into and understand our data very quickly.

    Genomic data is big though, so how can we do this? We use two different methods depending on the analysis being performed. Traditionaly methods perform a "global" analysis.
  </div>

  <div class='description' style="padding-top: 15px;">
    Our first analysis method is to sample data. Rather than look at everything, for some tasks, we can estimate statistics by sampling across the genome.
  </div>
  <img src="/public/images/cshl15/sampling_analysis.png" style="width: 250px; margin-left: 430px;">
  <div class='description' style="padding-top: 15px;">
    These sampling methods are well suited to checking the quality of data, for example, asking whether we believe that a BAM file consists of high-quality data, or whether we believe that there were problems with the sequencing experiment. Currently, the <i>bam.iobio</i>, <i>vcf.iobio</i>, and <i>taxonomer.iobio</i> apps are based on a sampling approach.
  </div>
  <div class='description' style="padding-top: 15px;">
    The next method is to read all data, but in a small region.
  </div>
  <img src="/public/images/cshl15/regional_analysis.png" style="width: 250px; margin-left: 430px;">
  <div class='description' style="padding-top: 15px;">
    As an example, if we want to search for genetic variants in a child with a known phenotype, it makes sense to start analysis looking only at genes that are known to be associated with the phenotype, rather than starting analysis considering all variants. The <i>gene.iobio</i> tools uses this methodology.

  <div class='description'>
    For the remainder of this tutorial, we will work with some examples together, using iobio tools to understand the data. As we step through this tutorial, open up and play with the data with the relevant iobio and see if you notice anything interesting about the datasets.
  </div>
  <div class='section-subtitle'>bam.iobio</div>
  <div class='description' style="padding-top: 15px;">
    Let's start by looking at a BAM file hosted on AWS. Follow this <a href="http://bam.iobio.io" target="_blank">link</a> to <i>bam.iobio</i> and click "choose bam url", then enter the following url <span class="code-list code-span panel panel-danger">https://s3.amazonaws.com/iobio/samples/bam/Sample12.bam</span>.

  <div class='description'>
    We can see a few important statistics about this bam file.
    <li>A chromosome selector,</li>
    <li>The average coverage across the genome,</li>
    <li>The read coverage distribution,</li>
    <li>The fragment length distribution,</li>
    <li>A host of other other useful statistics</li>
    Is there anything about this file that doesn't look as you might expect?
